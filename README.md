# UR200
Simple python script for bruteforcing name of files and directories on a web server URL
#######################################################################################
It takes a URL from user (as target) and a wordlist file (the words should not include '/') 
and tests the url with each of words in wordlist. At the end of bruteforce you the founded urls will be shown
so simple
Just , you will need a wordlist for running the bruteforce , and I don't have a perfect one , sorry :(
Find a useful one on your own
# Any thing U do with this script , is on your own risk 

# UR200 uses python3
then , run it with python 3
